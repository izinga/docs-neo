Creating Projects
=================

.. note::
   
   **Quick Start Overview**
   
   Creating a project on RobusTest is your first step towards comprehensive mobile app testing. This process typically takes 2-3 minutes and sets up your complete testing workspace.

On RobusTest, all activity related to the testing of a mobile app will be part of a *Project*. 

A Project is a logical workspace that contains all builds, test cases, test suites, test runs and test reports associated with your application testing. It also facilitates team collaboration and project organization.

.. admonition:: Pro Tips for Success
   :class: tip

   Follow these best practices to get the most out of your RobusTest project:

**üìù Naming Conventions**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Recommendation
     - Example
   * - Use descriptive project names
     - "MyApp_Android_v2.1" or "ECommerce_iOS_Production"
   * - Include version information
     - "ShoppingApp_v3.2_Beta" or "NewsApp_Release_2024"
   * - Environment specification
     - "MyApp_Staging" or "MyApp_Production"

**üë• Team Organization**

**Early Collaboration**

* Add team members immediately after project creation
* Assign appropriate admin privileges
* Set up notification preferences

**Environment Management**

* Create separate projects for different environments
* Use consistent naming across environments
* Maintain clear project ownership

**üì± Build Management**

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Upload Strategy
      
      * Upload builds with descriptive labels and version information
      * Include build notes and change logs
      * Tag builds with feature information
      
   .. tab:: Maintenance

      * Archive old builds rather than deleting them
      
   .. tab:: Automation
      
      * Set up remote upload API for CI/CD integration
      * Automate build uploads from your pipeline
      * Configure automatic notifications for new builds
