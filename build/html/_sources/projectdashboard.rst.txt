      **Protect Your Credentials**
      
      * **Environment Variables**: Store access keys in environment variables
      * **Secret Management**: Use CI/CD secret management systems
      * **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate access keys
      * **Access Control**: Limit who has access to API keys
      
      .. warning::
         
         **Never commit access keys to version control**

   .. grid-item-card:: üöÄ Automation Best Practices
      :class-header: bg-success text-white
      
      **Optimize Your Workflow**
      
      * **Build Validation**: Verify build success before upload
      * **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling
      * **Notifications**: Set up notifications for upload status
      * **Metadata**: Include meaningful build descriptions
      
      .. tip::
         
         **Test Automation**: Trigger automated tests after successful uploads


**4. Settings**

This section provides you the following options:

**a.** **Enable notifications** - On enabling this checkbox, each member of the team is notified whenever a new build is uploaded to the project

**b.** **Choose Bug Tracker configuration** - RobusTest supports Continuous Integration with your existing CI tools through APIs. 

Once you have integrated your Bug Tracker tool wih RobusTest, this configuration will be available for selection in the 'Bug Tracker' drop down. Once the required configuration is selected, all bugs encountered during your testing can be logged directly, from RobusTest, into the tool of your choice.

You can configure your project with the tool of your choice through the 'Integration' section of the RobusTest Admin Console.
