To install Java on your machine, follow the following instructions:

**1.** Python comes pre-installed with Mac and Linux machines

**2.** For Windows, download the latest version of Python for windows from `<http://python.org/downloads/>`_

   * An executable Installer file is downloaded
      
**3.** Run the Installer by clicking on it.

**4.** In the window that opens up, make sure that you enable the checkbox ‘*Add Python to PATH*’

**5.** Click on  ‘*Install Now*’ 
      
**6.** After successful installation, ensure that the option - ‘*Disable path length limit*’ - is chosen

**7.** Python now gets installed in the folder - C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32 

   * The last part of the folder structure (I.e. Python38-32) reflects the version of python you have installed. In the above case it is python 3.8
