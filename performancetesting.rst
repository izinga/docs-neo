Overview
--------

Mobile device fragmentation creates unique challenges for app performance. Users access your application on devices with:

* **Varying hardware configurations** - Different CPU, memory, and storage capabilities
* **Multiple Android versions** - Wide range of OS versions and manufacturer customizations
* **Diverse screen sizes and resolutions** - From compact phones to large tablets
* **Different network conditions** - 3G, 4G, WiFi, and varying connection speeds

Performance-First Approach
--------------------------

RobusTest adopts a performance-first methodology for mobile app testing. This means that during both manual testing sessions and automated test runs, comprehensive performance metrics are available at your fingertips.

**Key Performance Benefits:**

* **Real-time Monitoring**: Track performance metrics as you test
* **Historical Analysis**: Compare performance across different app versions
* **Device-Specific Insights**: Understand how your app performs on various devices
* **Bottleneck Identification**: Quickly identify performance issues before they impact users

Performance Monitoring During Testing
------------------------------------

**Manual Testing Performance Monitoring**

During manual testing sessions, you can monitor comprehensive performance metrics in real-time. The performance monitoring panel provides instant visibility into your app's resource consumption.

**Available Performance Metrics:**

Memory Usage Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Track critical memory usage parameters including:

* **Heap Memory**: Monitor allocated and used heap memory
* **Native Memory**: Track native memory consumption
* **Graphics Memory**: Monitor graphics-related memory usage
* **Memory Leaks**: Identify potential memory leak patterns

.. note::
   For detailed explanations of Android memory metrics, refer to the `Android Developer Documentation on Memory Management <http://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/debugging-memory.html>`_.

CPU Usage Monitoring  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monitor your application's CPU consumption with detailed insights:

* **Total CPU Usage**: Track overall CPU utilization
* **Per-Core Usage**: Monitor usage across individual CPU cores
* **Process-Specific Usage**: Isolate your app's CPU consumption

.. tip::
   **Understanding CPU Usage Over 100%**: On multi-core processors, CPU usage can exceed 100% when your app utilizes multiple cores simultaneously. However, sustained high usage may indicate performance optimization opportunities.

Network Usage Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monitor your app's network activity comprehensively:

* **Real-time Data Exchange**: Track live upload and download rates
* **Cumulative Session Data**: Monitor total data consumption for the entire test session
* **Network Request Analysis**: Analyze individual network requests and responses
* **Bandwidth Utilization**: Monitor how efficiently your app uses available bandwidth

   :class: important
   
   **User Experience Considerations**: High network usage significantly impacts user experience, especially on slower connections or limited data plans. Monitor not just the quantity of data transfer, but also the efficiency and necessity of each network operation.
   
   **Optimization Strategy**: Focus on reducing unnecessary network calls, implementing intelligent caching, and optimizing data transfer sizes to improve both performance and user satisfaction.
