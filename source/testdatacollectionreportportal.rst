Test Data Collection: Report Portal
===================================

To push data to Report Portal, you have to create appropriate *test data collection* entries in your run setting.

For each artefact that you wish to push to Report Portal (e.g test results, logs, etc.), you need to create a separate test data collection.

**Creating Test Data Collections**

In the *Test Data Collection* section, you need to enter the following details:

1. **testDataCollections.integrationType**

   * In this field, enter the value *reportPortal*

2. **testDataCollections.integrationID** 

   * In this field, enter the Integration ID of your Report Portal Integration entry from the Admin Console -> Integrations section

3. **testDataCollections.testDataPoint**

   * The value entered in this field determines the artefact that will be pushed to report Portal.


   * You can enter one of the following values in this field:

     **1. stats**

        * This ensures that the results of your job run are pushed to Report Portal.

        * This data includes:

          * test case stats , i.e., number of passes, fails, errors, total count, pass percentage, etc.
          * job related details, i.e., start time, emd time, duration, etc.
          * list of test cases and their details, etc.

        * It is **mandatory** to have *one test data collection entry where the value is* '**stats**'.

     **2. deviceLog**

	    * This helps push the device logs for the devices used in your job to be pushed to Report Portal

     **3. result**

	    * This pushes the framework log to Report Portal.

	    * By framework log, we are referring to the log generated by the automation framework that you use such as Espresso, Appium, XCUITest, etc.

     **4. screenshot**

	    * This pushes all screenshots generated by your job to Report Portal.
